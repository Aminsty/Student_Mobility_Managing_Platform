# Student_Mobility_Managing_Platform
School Project of Web Development, permitting for the school administration to manage student mobility applications and to process them in an easy way.
We have first the home section of the site, after which he can go to the login page as a student, all of the student's pages are in the "etudiant" folder, the admin should go directly to his page without a prompted login, with of course a more secure mecanism to be added later for his provided adress with which he can enter his section of the site, the admin's pages are in the "admin_pages" folder.
Overall this project is made for managing the foreign mobility process for my school ENSA Khouribga's administration so it uses the provided data as a reference, it divides this management to 2 parts, one on the student side and the other on the admin side that of course has more freedom to manipulate data and to alter admissions.
